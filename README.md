Quorum Examples
This repository contains scripts for advanced deployment and connection to the Keyword Extraction.

Usage notice
This project is meant for advanced keyword extraction users (mainly NLP contributors) who are already familiar with Keywork extraction deployments and who are looking for some advanced configurations for their network.

If you have a limited experience with Quorum, or if you are looking to start a Keywork Extraction for some testing purposes then you should instead use our extraction-dev-quickstart.

We do not guarantee that all scripts in this project work out of the box, in particular some scripts may be out of date and will require some adjustments from users to properly work on latest Extraction versions.
